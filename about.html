        Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions. 
        Itâ€™s a peer-to-peer system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. 
        Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, 
        cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. 
        When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. 
        Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. Cryptocurrency received its name because it uses encryption to verify transactions. 
        This means advanced coding is involved in storing and transmitting cryptocurrency data between wallets and to public ledgers. 
        The aim of encryption is to provide security and safety.

Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. Additional founders of Ethereum included Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Anthony Di Iorio and Joseph Lubin. In 2014, development work commenced and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015. The platform allows anyone to deploy permanent and immutable decentralized applications onto it, with which users can interact. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs, which are non-fungible tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and sold as unique digital property.";

Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of the proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain Ethereum, understood the implications of these challenges to blockchain networks, and began developing Cardano and its primary cryptocurrency, ada, in 2015, launching the platform and the ada token in 2017.";
